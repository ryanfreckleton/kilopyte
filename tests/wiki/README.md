Kilopyte Wiki
=============
**Goal:** A minimal, but complete, WikiWikiWeb implemented in python, using the WSGI standard and only standard library.
**Status:** Struggling to figure out the right way to test this.
**Actions:** Simplify, only use pytest and create both a `wiki_acceptance_test.py` and `wiki_test.py`
