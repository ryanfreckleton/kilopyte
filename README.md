# Kilopyte
Fully functional and production python libraries, engines and applications in less than 1 kilobyte, depending only on
the standard library.

## Summary
This is a collection of projects that take less than 1 kilobyte of space when minified and compressed using cutting edge
compression algorithms.  Runtime and production dependencies are limited to other kilopyte modules or the standard
library.

There are no constraints on the development and testing libraries used.  The aim is to have very high quality, but small
modules to fulfill simple purposes like wikis, blog engines, testing and algorithms.
